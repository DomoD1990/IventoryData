ID (Iventory data) APK.  Chinese, English version later.
This is a small tool which made for sorting up some small items.
Reason why building this tool is that I have encountered a problem. 
Problem is that I know I have something but I can not find or remember where it is!!!
So i have generated this tool for sorting those small or sigle items.
All data will be on your smartphone.
You will need to generate items catagorize as: item/container/equipment/space/location.
Location first!
For Eg:
you generate location: home.
then you generate space: living room (belongs to home);
hence you generate equipment: chair (belongs to living room);
or you can generate contianer: box (belongs to living room);
finally you can generate items: SD disk (belongs to box).
when you need to find SD disk, you can search SD then you can find it is belongs to box 1.
each items you can add photo by taking one or chosing from your elbum.
That is all. 
Thanks for reading!
